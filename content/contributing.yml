  h2. Will You?!
  
  I’d love it if you felt like contributing to Pekky. More than anything I need people to start using it, bug-testing it and giving me feed back on the API and potential features it needs. So even if you can’t contribute code, there is much you can do.
  
  If you need to contact me in any way, you can message me on "GitHub":http://github.com/lukesutton
  
  h2. Contributing Code
  
  If you feel like contributing code, the first thing you should do is make a fork of the project on GitHub. If you don’t have a GitHub account, you should get one of those first :)
  
  h3. Dependencies
  
  Once you have forked the repo and cloned it to your local machine, you will need to install the following dependencies:
    
  * "Rocco":http://github.com/rtomayko/rocco - Generating documentation
  * "Bacon":http://github.com/chneukirchen/bacon - Running specs
  * "Thor":http://github.com/wycats/thor - Task runner
  
  h3. Todos
  
  Have a look in the <code>README</code> file. It’ll show any jobs that need doing. In particular Pekky needs better spec coverage and documentation of the API. What can I say? I’m a bit slack sometimes.
  
  h3. Contributing Back
  
  Once you make your changes, commit, push to your GitHub fork, then send me a fork request. First accepted patch earns a high-five and a commit-bit on the main repo.
